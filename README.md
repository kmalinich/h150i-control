# h150i-control
Corsair H150i pump speed control (node.js)

[liquidctl](https://github.com/liquidctl/liquidctl) does this much better, I'm just playing with hacking on USB devices from node.

It doesn't work (yet), in fact, it will actually break the USB connection to the pump and require you to unplug and re-plug the device. So don't use it.
